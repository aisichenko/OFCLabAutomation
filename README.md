# OFCLabAutomation
Demo for the OFC Lab Automation Hackathon

### Other interesting resources

From June 6, 2021 lab automation hackathon:

- [s-fifteen](https://github.com/s-fifteen-instruments/pyS15)
- [Physics-aware Training, McMahon lab, Cornell](https://github.com/mcmahon-lab/Physics-Aware-Training)
- [Data logging with Neptune?](https://neptune.ai/)

### Thoughts for next hackathon

- hopefully it is not virtual!
- Have some time for those that run each booth to walk around to other booths to see the demos
- github repo for each year where presenters link their repos in a readme or upload their demo notebooks
